signed using my original composition: "SillyOcean.pdf"

Cnadian-Solidarity.pdf and calhouns_rats.pdf were composed using online and onground research between 2019-11-20 and 2020-02-15. It was in anticipation that when biochem and digital viruses instigate a culling of humane species a cultural solution would be needed to address the primary problem of communication breakdowns at all levels of socioetechnical existence within a tattered ecology. 

My purpose in uploading these documents to a public repository with Creative Commons Zero (CC0) licensing is to voluntarily aid thought leaders in constructing similar projects or ventures in their communities for rejuvenating the global ecology, within due timespace.
